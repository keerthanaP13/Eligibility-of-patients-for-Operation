Logistic regression is a linear model but with a nonlinear response. The response is binary, { 0, 1 }, or Yes and No. The response is the prediction of the category.

some basic properties of the logistic regression model are presented.

Logistic regression is widely used as a classification model. Logistic regression is a linear model, with a binary response, {False, True} or {0, 1}. You can think of this response as having a Binomial distribution. For linear regression, the response is just, well, linear. Logistic regression is a linear regression model with a nonlinear output. The response of the linear model is transformed or 'squashed' to values close to 0 and 1 using a sigmoidal function, also known as the logistic function. The result of this transformation is a response which is the log-likelihood for each of the two classes.
